Libraries needed for python development of code. Python is slower than C++ but much easier to code with. As this project is trying to get pilot data for future research, our development will consist of python code using the following libraries:

1. numpy				for powerful tools
2. cv2					for image processing
3. matplotlib			for plotting data
4. Tkinter				for GUI

Steps to download the libraries in Ubuntu14.04.1

1. for numpy and cv2 open the terminal and run the command,

	sudo apt-get install python-opencv

2. for matplotlib open the terminal and run the command

	sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

3. for Tkinter open the terminal and run the command

	sudo apt-get install python python-tk idle python-pmw python-imaging


Make sure to have access to the apt repositories before running the above commands.
